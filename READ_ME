Minimal ORM in Python
This project demonstrates the implementation of a minimalist Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system in Python.
ORM allows developers to interact with databases using Python objects, eliminating the need to write raw SQL queries.

Overview
This project includes:

Model definitions via Python classes (e.g., User).
Automatic table creation in an SQLite database.
Saving objects to the database.
Retrieving all records from the database.
